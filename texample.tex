The following listing is of the example \TeX\ file \p{story.tex},
which should be available in your \TeX\ distribution.  It is also
listed on page 24 of D. E. Knuth’s {\sl The \TeX book}.

You can of course use any example file you want.  \p{story.tex}
merely happens to be the “first” example file in the \TeX\
collective consciousness.  74.3\% of all \TeX\ users learned
\TeX\ by analyzing this file.
