Installing TeX2page

-

Download the TeX2page distribution package from
http://www.ccs.neu.edu/~dorai/tex2page/index.html
(link immediately follows title).

TeX2page is distributed as a bzip2ed, tar file
tex2page.tar.bz2.  Unpacking it, viz.,

  bunzip2 tex2page.tar.bz2
  tar xf tex2page.tar

produces a directory called tex2page, which
contains, among other things, the files

  tex2page
  tex2page.tex
  tex2page.sty

Put copies of (or link to) the files tex2page.tex and
tex2page.sty in a directory that is in your
TEXINPUTS path.

SECTION 1.  Configuring TeX2page for your machine

If your dialect is Racket, you may directly use the
`tex2page' script in this directory.  Put it in your
PATH.  For Windows, put the batch file `tex2page.bat'
in your PATH.  Correct  the pathnames of `racket' and
`tex2page' in `tex2page.bat' if needed.

If you use Common Lisp, you may copy the script `tex2page.lisp' as
`tex2page' into your PATH.

For other Scheme dialects and also for Common Lisp (if you
wish to have a machine-translation of the Scheme tex2page),
the following method usually has a good chance of working on
Unix-like systems.  If you are not connected to the Internet
or don't have wget, it will help to ensure that you have
Scmxlate already installed on your system.  Scmxlate is
available at
http://www.ccs.neu.edu/~dorai/scmxlate/index.html.

Type

   ./configure --help

to see the list of dialects the makefile supports.  If
your dialect D is one of them, type

   ./configure --dialect=D

This creates a file `my-tex2page', which is a version
of `tex2page' configured for the dialect.

Note: If you are on a Unix-like environment blessed with
lots of GNU software, e.g. Linux and Cygwin, chances are you
already have or can easily install Guile.  On such systems,
simply type

   ./configure --dialect=guile

If your dialect is not supported, or the make fails for
whatever reason, you can invoke Scmxlate directly.
First ensure that Scmxlate is installed on your system.

Start your Scheme or Common Lisp in this
directory; then explicitly load the file
scmxlate.scm, using the correct pathname.  E.g.,

   (load "/usr/local/lib/scmxlate/scmxlate.scm")

You will be asked a few questions.  A choice of answers
will be provided, so you don't have to be too creative.
A file called `my-tex2page' is created.  On Windows, a
batch file called `tex2page.bat' is also created.

You can rename `my-tex2page' to `tex2page' and put it
in your PATH.  On Windows, move `tex2page.bat' to your
PATH, and also edit its contents so that the pathnames
it refers to are correct.

-

SECTION 2. Can't create a working script file?

If you are unable to create a script file to put in
your PATH, you may simply load tex2page (or
my-tex2page) directly into your Scheme, and
then call the Scheme procedure tex2page on your
source document, e.g.,

  (load "my-tex2page")
  (tex2page "jobname.tex")

-

SECTION 3. Image generation

(Skip this section if you're *not* running Windows.)

The image generation subprocess in tex2page uses
Ghostscript.  The tex2page code stores the name of the
Ghostscript executable name in the variable
*ghostscript*.  For Unix, this value is "gs", which
is pretty standard.  If you're using Windows, check
that the value assigned to *ghostscript* is correct
for you.

-

SECTION 4. Generating the documentation

The tex2page documentation is provided in
the TeX file index.tex.  To get a PDF
version of the document run, first ensure
that the file story.log exists.  If it does
not, run

  pdftex story

and supply

  \end

at TeX's interactive prompt.  Then do

  pdftex index
  makeindex index
  mpost lambda
  pdftex index
  pdftex index

The first TeX run may fail due to missing files.
Simply type s at the TeX prompt to force TeX
to continue.

The multiple runs of TeX are needed to resolve
cross-references.  

If the MetaPost executable
is named `mp' on your system (e.g., MiKTeX),
change `mpost' to `mp'.

To get an HTML version of the document, run

  tex2page index

a few times.  As with TeX, multiple runs of tex2page
are needed to resolve cross-references, but each
run of tex2page will explicitly tell you if another
run is necessary.

The WWW copy of the HTML documentation (with a
link for downloading the distribution) is at
http://www.ccs.neu.edu/~dorai/tex2page/index.html.
