The following listing  is of the example TeX file
\p{story.tex}, which should be
available in the \p{.../|meta[texmf]/tex/plain/base/} part of
your TeX distribution.  It is also listed on page 24 of
D E Knuth's {\em The TeXbook}.  A copy is included in
the TeX2page distribution.

You can of course use any example file you want.  \p{story.tex}
merely happens to be the ``first'' example file in the TeX
collective consciousness.  74.3\% of all TeX users learned
TeX by analyzing this file.
